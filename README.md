## Description

Digi-Dex (Digital Rolodex) is a test-driven object-oriented command-line application that dynamically generates a quality front-end Team Roster for User's memory. This application uses Node.js, Jest.js, and Inquirer.js in tandem to generate the finished product. Can be advantageous for personal or professional use, although User Story is written for the latter. Please use the Table of Contents below to navigate through the documentation and learn more!

## Usage
### User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

### Acceptance Criteria 

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineerâ€™s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the internâ€™s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
